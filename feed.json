There are options to highlight the current line, sentence, or paragraph and an option to mark the current line which adds a grey box around the current line.\n\nDropbox syncing was added in v2.6. iCloud syncing has worked flawlessly for me with Ulysses and I don&#039;t plan on changing to Dropbox syncing but I did try out Dropbox syncing and didn&#039;t had any issues with it.\n\nThe Soulmen also added what they call Quick Open which allows you to search your entire library for text, keywords, or group names. VoiceOver support for the entire app was added as well.\n\nUlysses is, without a doubt, my favorite writing app and version 2.6 makes it even better. Do yourself a favor and check it out.

				"content_text": "<em>Update: Added a restriction that I was aware of but had forgotten about. </em>\n\nSince <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gboard-search.-gifs.-emojis/id1091700242?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3vx9E\">Gboard</a> was released last week, iOS third-party keyboards, and the restrictions Apple places on them, have been getting more attention than I've probably seen since iOS 8 was released. The comment I have seen most often about Gboard is that it is a nothing but a \"keylogger\" for Google, even though it plainly states \"Other than your searches, Gboard doesn't send anything you type to Google.\"<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> In his recent <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/notes/on-the-limitations-of-ios-custom-keyboards/\">article on the subject</a>, Federico Viticci had this to say:\n\n<blockquote>I struggle to understand the position of those who call custom keyboards \"keyloggers\" because, frankly, that's a discussion we should have had two years ago, not as soon as Google launches a custom keyboard. Since 2014, hundreds of companies (including Microsoft and Giphy) have released custom keyboards, each theoretically capable of \"logging\" what you type. That ship has sailed.</blockquote>\n\nI am more concerned with one of those celebrity emoji keyboards or one of the countless \"create your own theme\" type keyboards being a keylogger much more than I am about Gboard being one.\n\n<blockquote>I also have to wonder if, two years into custom keyboards, it would be time for Apple to lift some of their other keyboard restrictions. To recap, this is what custom keyboards on iOS <em>can't</em> do:\n<ul>\n    <li>Access the system settings of Auto-Capitalization, Enable Caps Lock, and dictionary reset feature</li>\n    <li>Type into secure text input objects (password fields)</li>\n    <li>Type into phone pad objects (phone dialer UIs)</li>\n    <li>Access selected text</li>\n    <li>Access the device microphone</li>\n    <li>Use the system keyboard switching popup</li>\n</ul>\nAside from microphone access, secure input fields, and phone pad objects, I'd like to see Apple add support for everything else in iOS 10. More importantly, I'd like to see their performance improve. Here's an example: when you swipe down from the Home screen to open Spotlight, Apple's keyboard comes up with a soft transition that's pleasing on the eye; if you do the same with a custom keyboard, the transition is always jarring, and it often doesn't work at all.</blockquote>\n\nThat last restriction is one I have never understood. Not having access to the popup keyboard picker in third-party keyboards makes it a huge pain to switch between them and I have never understood what harm could come from allowing third-party keyboards to access it. I don't know if this is another Apple restriction on third-party keyboards or developers simply not implementing it, but I have yet to see a third-party keyboard with 3D Touch trackpad functionality.<sup><a id=\"ffn2\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> The 3D Touch trackpad is the biggest thing I miss about the stock keyboard when I use a third-party keyboard.

The first two would require some changes to iOS and it's restrictions in order for them to ever be added to Gboard. If a Gboard-like keyboard were to become the stock iOS keyboard I would hope that Apple would let users change the search engine the keyboard uses, and using Google for dictation instead of Siri would require Apple to let users to set a default option for apps and services.</li>\n    <li>3D Touch trackpad functionality is something I would like to see added to Gboard in the future, though it may require a restriction removal.
